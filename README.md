# Incident Response Tool

This is a simple web application designed to simulate cybersecurity incidents and generate tailored incident response plans based on severity levels (Low, Medium, High)

I created this project to apply the theory I learned in **INFS2701** (Managing Cybersecurity in the Digital Age) to real world scenarios, focusing on frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This tool is currently basic in functionality, serving as an educational and demonstration resource to help users understand how incidents are classified and how to respond using structured frameworks.

I plan to expand its functionality as I continue to gain more skills and experience in cybersecurity.
